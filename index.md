### CPSC 120

* Lab 2

    Lab 2, Part 1 was actually one of my favorite labs since it was the first lab to made me realize how cool coding can be. It was the first time where I successfully coded something on my own. Despite it being standard input/output commands, it felt refreshing and rewarding when I had realzied that my code worked. Also it was kind of fun testing the code in the end where you put in random words to fill in the sentence. 

* Lab 7

    Lab 7, Part 2 was definitely a favorite of mine since I was already so familiar with the game of BlackJack before heading into the lab. Coding something that you're already interested/passionate about makes the whole process much more easier and enjoyable which easily made this lab one of my favorites. Being able to correctly value the face cards/numbers was a challenge, especially with the Ace card having multiple values, however once my lab partner and I figured it out it felt very accomplishing. 

* Lab 8

    Lab 8, Part 2 is the final lab part that stands out to me as it helped fully develop my understanding of loops. In this part of the lab we used a combination of for loops to create an output that had one less bar for each row downwards that was replaced by a dash. The part that ultimately stook out to me was just the satisfaction of seeing the for loops work at the end, in which the output presented looked cleanly symmetrical. I also in general just enjoy coding loops and this lab is the first one that I think of whenever coding loops.
